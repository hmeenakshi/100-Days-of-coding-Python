## Statement
```
One spy plane alone has gone missing, so its ID was not added to the  
list a second time.  By the way, IDs are not guaranteed to be  
sorted or sequential.   

1. Given a list of plane IDs, write a program to print out the ID of 
the missing spy plane. 
2. If no plane is found missing, then print "All arrived!"  
```

d = "All arrived!"
for i in range(a):
  b.append(int(input()))
for i in range(a):
  c = b[i]
  if (b.count(c)%2 != 0):
    d=b[i]
print(d)
```
## Output

All arrived!
