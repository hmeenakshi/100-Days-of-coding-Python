## Statement
```
JugsMugsPugs Special
SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: 
Try and limit the number of conditional statements to not more than two. 
This requires some advanced Python language knowledge. I don't expect everyone  
to be able to complete this.

Write a program that receives a number on the input and prints values from 1 to that number subjected to the conditions below. 
It also should receive another value 'rev' (either 0 or 1) on the input. 

For every number in the given range,   
- If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs".   
- If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".  
- If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".

- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".        
  - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"  
- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".        
  - also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
 - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs".
       - also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"

Otherwise, it prints the number.

REVERSE REQUIREMENT:
If the boolean 'rev' is True (or 1), then reverse the order of printing.    
  - "PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7   
  - "PugsMugs" for multiple of 3 and 7   
  - "MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5    
  - "PugsJugs" for multiple of 5 and 7
```
## Input

False

15
True
```	
## Code
```
num=int(input())
rev=bool(input())
for i in range(1,num+1):
  temp=""
  if(rev=="False"):
    temp+=("Jugs"*int((i%3==0) or ("3" in str(i)))) + ("Mugs"*int((i%5==0) or ("5" in str(i)))) + ("Pugs"*int((i%7==0) or ("7" in str(i)))) 
    print(temp or i)  
  else:
    temp+=("Pugs"*int((i%7==0) or ("7" in str(i)))) + ("Mugs"*int((i%5==0) or ("5" in str(i)))) + ("Jugs"*int((i%3==0) or ("3" in str(i))))
    print(temp or i)
```
